# Tableau Workshop Project: Wellness Center Analysis in India

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing a dataset of wellness centers across India, focusing on the distribution of centers, doctor counts, and their specialties. Utilizing Tableau, we've conducted a comprehensive analysis to identify potential locations for opening new wellness centers based on the availability and specialty of doctors.

## Data Visualization and Analysis

### Objective 1: Mapping Wellness Centers

- **Objective**: To visualize the geographical distribution of wellness centers across India.
- **Method**: Plotted the locations on the map of India using latitude and longitude coordinates, coloring the map from red to yellow based on doctor count.
- **Findings**: The map provided a clear visualization of wellness center distribution, highlighting areas with high and low doctor availability.

### Objective 2: City-wise Center Counts

- **Objective**: To identify cities with the highest number of wellness centers.
- **Method**: Created a bar graph visualizing the count of centers in each city.
- **Findings**: Delhi/NCR has the highest number of centers, followed by Mumbai and Hyderabad, indicating a saturated market in these regions.

### Objective 3: Doctor Specialties Analysis

- **Objective**: To analyze the count of doctors based on their specialties.
- **Method**: Utilized a text table to categorize doctor counts by specialty.
- **Findings**: Allopathic doctors are more prevalent than any other specialty, indicating a potential demand for other categories of medical professionals.

### Objective 4: Specialty Distribution in Cities

- **Objective**: To explore the distribution of doctor specialties across different cities.
- **Method**: Employed a bar graph depicted with circles to show the distribution of each category of doctor in each city.
- **Findings**: This analysis highlights the diversity of doctor specialties in various cities, with allopathic doctors being the most common across all locations.

## Conclusion

- **Insight**: The analysis reveals a higher demand for non-allopathic medical professionals, suggesting an opportunity to diversify the specialties offered in new wellness centers.
- **Recommendation**: Opening a wellness center in Delhi may present challenges due to high competition. However, cities like Hyderabad and Mumbai offer a promising market with less saturation and a diverse population that could benefit from a wider range of medical specialties.
- **Strategic Advantage**: Focusing on offering services from underrepresented medical specialties could provide a competitive edge in these metropolitan areas.

This project underscores the importance of data-driven decision-making in expanding the healthcare industry, particularly in the wellness sector. By leveraging Tableau for comprehensive data analysis, stakeholders can identify strategic opportunities for growth and development.
